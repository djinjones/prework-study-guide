## Description

The prework study guide is a webpage to store notes for the full stack web development bootcamp. It utilizes HTML, CSS, git, and Javascript to introduce a very basic level of coding. As the course goes on and more information is learned, the page will be updated with both notes and code to reflect my understanding of web development.

Secondly it is a place to apply learned knowledge involving the different code we will learn such as: using css to make the webpage to look more presentable or using Javascript to implement more logic to the webpage. Finally, this study guide can be used to practice the proper usage of github to implement changes to a project with other colaborators.
